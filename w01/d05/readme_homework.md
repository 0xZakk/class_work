## Let's Play High-Card-Wins

Game time! Create a new file called `high_card.rb` for this exercise.

**Methods to research:**

* `each_with_index`
* `max`

**Tasks:**

1. Build a deck of shuffled cards… maybe you can leverage some old code? *Hint: you may want to add some additional card data!*
2. Collect an array of player names by prompting:
	* **"{n} players so far. Enter a player name, or type 'play':"**
	* Maybe you can leverage some old code here?
3. Upon *"play"*, deal each player a card.
4. Find the highest card score dealt (Aces high).
5. Find the winning player name, then print out:
	* **"Winner(s): {name1, name2, …}!"**

### Bonus…

Print out *one* of the following outcomes:

* **"The winner is {name}!"**
* **"It's a tie between {name1, name2, …}!"**

## Reading on Object Oriented Programming

As a preview for next week, we'd like you to read up a bit on Object-Oriented
Programming in Ruby.

As a minimum, please read through:
* The [Chapter on Classes](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_09.html) in Learn to Program

We strongly suggest you spend at least 30 minutes - 1 hour working on one of the
exercises in "A Few Things to Try" at the end of the chapter.

If you want more reading or exercises, we suggest the following additional
resources (totally optional, but useful):
* [The OOP Chapter on TutsPoint](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_object_oriented.htm)
* [CodeAcademy's Unit on Classes](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-MFiQ6/0/1)

## Relax!

Make sure you relax a bit this weekend... watch some Netflix, get some sleep, eat
a dozen doughnuts, whatever gets you ready for next week!
